# Tinlance

> Production-grade AI engineering and Forward Deployed Engineering for enterprise automation, AI infrastructure, security, and intelligent systems.

Tinlance is being rebuilt from the ground up as a public engineering platform. The repository is intentionally designed to demonstrate production engineering discipline: typed application code, secure boundaries, automated validation, reproducible deployment, and a separate AI/FDE execution layer.

## Repository layout

- `apps/web` — Tinlance's Next.js application.
- `apps/fde-api` — reserved boundary for the Python FDE execution service.
- `packages` — shared contracts, UI, and configuration.
- `content` — case studies, research, insights, services, and industry content.
- `docs` — architecture, security, and architecture decision records.
- `tests` — cross-application end-to-end and integration tests.

## Engineering standards

- TypeScript strict mode.
- Automated linting, type checking, tests, and production builds.
- Secure-by-default HTTP headers.
- Typed environment boundaries and no secret values in source control.
- Request correlation IDs for application observability.
- Health and readiness endpoints for deployment/platform checks.
- Dependency and supply-chain security are part of CI.
- Material architecture decisions are documented.
- Public code is treated as inspectable by prospective CTOs and security teams.

## Build status

**All planned phases are complete.**

Phases 0–9 have been completed in sequence. Phase 9 — Enterprise Hardening & Launch — was the final gated phase, covering security hardening, supply-chain controls, quality validation, observability, recovery, accessibility, performance, and production-readiness verification.

**There is no Phase 10 in the current roadmap.** Future work is maintenance, incremental product development, security updates, customer-driven improvements, and new versioned initiatives—not unfinished rebuild phases.

The final launch gate is documented in [`docs/PHASE9-LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md`](./docs/PHASE9-LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md).

## License

No open-source license is currently granted. The repository is public for transparency and engineering credibility; public visibility does not grant permission to reuse proprietary source code.

## Security

See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting and the security baseline.
